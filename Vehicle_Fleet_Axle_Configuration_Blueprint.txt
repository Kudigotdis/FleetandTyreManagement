Vehicle Master & Axle Configuration
Module Purpose: This module defines how many tyres the system should expect for a specific vehicle (linked to a BX plate or fleet ID). It acts as a hard validation layer so users cannot over‑log or under‑log tyres (e.g., logging 6 tyres on a 4‑wheel Toyota Hilux).
This configuration becomes the truth table the rest of the tyre system obeys.
1) VEHICLE MASTER (Primary Identity)
Purpose: Establishes the vehicle archetype before any tyre data is captured.
Core Fields
• Vehicle Identifier
◦ BX Plate / Fleet ID
• Vehicle Type (Dropdown)
◦ Sedan
◦ Hatchback
◦ SUV
◦ Bakkie / Pickup
◦ Ambulance
◦ Minibus
◦ Bus
◦ 7‑Ton Truck
◦ 10‑Ton Truck
◦ Articulated Truck / Horse
◦ Trailer (Single / Double)
• Drive Type (Optional but recommended)
◦ FWD
◦ RWD
◦ AWD
◦ 4×4
2) AXLE CONFIGURATION
Purpose: Defines the physical axle layout and enforces tyre count rules.
Axle Count
• 2 Axles → Passenger cars, SUVs, bakkies
• 3 Axles → Rigid trucks, ambulances with rear dually
• 4+ Axles → Heavy trucks, articulated vehicles
Axle Type (Per Axle)
Each axle is defined independently: - Steering Axle - Drive Axle - Tag / Lift Axle - Trailer Axle
3) TYRE POSITION MAP (Critical Validation Layer)
Purpose: Explicitly defines every legal tyre position the vehicle may have.
Standard Position Naming Convention
Front Axle: - Front‑Left (FL) - Front‑Right (FR)
Rear / Drive Axle (Single Wheel): - Rear‑Left (RL) - Rear‑Right (RR)
Rear / Drive Axle (Dual Wheel / Dually): - Rear‑Outer‑Left (ROL) - Rear‑Inner‑Left (RIL) - Rear‑Inner‑Right (RIR) - Rear‑Outer‑Right (ROR)
Additional Axles (If Applicable): - Axle2‑Left / Axle2‑Right - Axle2‑Inner‑Left / Axle2‑Outer‑Left - Axle2‑Inner‑Right / Axle2‑Outer‑Right
4) PREDEFINED VEHICLE TEMPLATES (Recommended)
Example 1: Sedan (e.g., Toyota Corolla)
• Axle Count: 2
• Tyre Count: 4
• Positions:
◦ FL, FR, RL, RR
Example 2: Toyota Hilux / Ford Ranger
• Vehicle Type: Bakkie
• Axle Count: 2
• Tyre Count: 4
• Positions:
◦ FL, FR, RL, RR
(System rule: Reject 5th or 6th tyre entries)
Example 3: Ambulance (Rear Dually)
• Axle Count: 2
• Tyre Count: 6
• Positions:
◦ FL, FR
◦ ROL, RIL, RIR, ROR
Example 4: 7‑Ton Truck
• Axle Count: 3
• Tyre Count: 10
• Positions:
◦ FL, FR
◦ Axle2‑Inner‑Left, Axle2‑Outer‑Left
◦ Axle2‑Inner‑Right, Axle2‑Outer‑Right
◦ Axle3‑Inner‑Left, Axle3‑Outer‑Left
◦ Axle3‑Inner‑Right, Axle3‑Outer‑Right
5) SYSTEM RULES & VALIDATION LOGIC
Hard Rules
• Tyre entries must match the vehicle’s tyre position map
• Extra tyre entries are rejected
• Missing tyre positions are flagged
• Tyre rotation only allowed between compatible positions
Soft Rules (Warnings)
• Different brands on same axle
• Different tread depth left vs right
• Mismatched load or speed rating per axle
6) WHY THIS MODULE MATTERS
• Prevents human error
• Enforces mechanical realism
• Enables axle‑based analytics
• Supports future features:
◦ Tyre rotation history
◦ Axle wear analysis
◦ Fleet compliance audits
Design Note: This module should load before tyre capture, inspection, or replacement workflows. All downstream tyre data should reference this configuration as immutable truth.
