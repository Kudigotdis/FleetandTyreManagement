I’ve created a single downloadable canvas document titled:
“Tyre Management App – Master Data Reference Tables (Botswana)”
What you now have (clean + realistic)
✅ 10 separate Master Data tables
✅ 50 total dummy rows (5 per table)
✅ Botswana-specific (Gaborone, districts, ministries, vendors)
✅ Designed for Google Sheets / Excel (1 sheet per table)
✅ Perfect for dropdowns, calculators, and offline mode
This directly solves the problem you explained:
No more “Gabs / Gaborone / Gabs City” nonsense breaking reports.
How to use this immediately (practical steps)
Download the document
Open Excel or Google Sheets
Create one workbook
Create 10 sheets, named exactly as the tables
Copy-paste each table into its own sheet
Lock these sheets → use them as reference sources only
Your Tyre Entry table should now store:
Ministry ID
Station ID
Vehicle Type ID
Tyre Spec ID
Vendor ID—not text.
That’s how you get:
Faster app performance
Accurate BWP cost-per-km
Audit-proof reporting
Zero typo chaos
Why this is the right architecture (real talk)
This is the same Master Data → Transaction Data separation used in:
SAP Fleet
Oracle Transport
Government ERP systems
But you’ve adapted it to offline + WhatsApp + Botswana reality, which most big systems completely fail at.

📊 Sample “Tyre Transaction” sheet that references these masters
🚨 Fraud & anomaly rules (e.g. theft spikes per station)
📱 Offline-first sync logic (how phones reconcile later)

Approved Supplier (Vendor) Registry
Module Purpose:This module defines who the system is allowed to buy tyres from. It enforces procurement discipline by restricting purchases to PPRA-registered, government-approved suppliers, while also modeling real-world communication, where WhatsApp is the primary channel and vendors have multiple human contacts with different roles.
This is a governance + trust layer, not just a contact list.
1) VENDOR MASTER (Company-Level Truth)
Purpose: Establishes the legal entity that is approved to supply tyres.
Core Vendor Fields
Vendor ID (System-generated)
Vendor Name (Registered Legal Name)
Trading Name (If different)
PPRA Registration Number
Tax Identification Number (TIN)
VAT Registered (Yes / No)
Physical Location
City / Town
Industrial Area / Mall / Plot
Operating Region
National
Regional
City-specific
Contract Start Date
Contract Expiry Date
Contract Status (Auto-calculated)
Active
Expiring Soon (e.g. < 90 days)
Expired (Hard Block)
Compliance Flags (System-Controlled)
PPRA Validated
Tax Clearance Valid
Approved for Government Procurement
Approved for Emergency Procurement (Optional)
2) SUPPLIER CAPABILITIES (What They’re Allowed to Sell)
Purpose: Prevents vendors from supplying items outside their approved scope.
Capability Fields
Product Categories Approved
Passenger Tyres
SUV / 4×4 Tyres
Commercial / LT Tyres
Off-Road / M/T Tyres
Approved Brands (Multi-select)

3) VENDOR CONTACT PROFILES (Human-Level Registry)
Purpose: Models the actual people you talk to on WhatsApp, calls, and email — not just the company.
Contact Profile (Linked to Vendor ID)
Each vendor can have multiple contacts, each with a full profile.
Identity Fields
Contact ID (System-generated)
Full Name
Role / Title
Sales Rep

Call
Email
Trust & Usage Metadata
Is Primary Contact (Yes / No)
Authorized to Quote Prices (Yes / No)
Authorized to Sign / Approve Orders (Yes / No)
Last Contacted Date
Responsiveness Rating (Internal)
4) WHATSAPP-FIRST DESIGN LOGIC
Purpose: Aligns the app with real Southern African business behavior.
WhatsApp Integration Logic (Conceptual)
Each Vendor → Many Contacts
Each Contact → One or more WhatsApp numbers
Orders, quotes, and confirmations are:
Logged as WhatsApp interactions
Tagged to a specific contact profile
Practical App Features
One-tap WhatsApp launch from contact profile
Conversation notes attached to contact
Quote screenshots or PDFs attached per contact
Visibility into who said what and when
5) PROCUREMENT CONTROL RULES
Hard Rules (System Enforced)
Purchases only allowed from vendors with:
Active contract
Valid PPRA registration
Valid Tax ID
Expired contracts = vendor locked
Quotes from non-authorized contacts are rejected
Soft Rules (Warnings)
Vendor has only one contact (risk)
Primary contact unresponsive
Contract nearing expiry
6) WHY THIS MODULE MATTERS
Prevents fraud and ghost suppliers
Aligns with government audit requirements
Reflects how procurement actually works on the ground
Protects staff from "my guy at the tyre shop" behavior
7) FUTURE EXTENSIONS (Designed-In)
PPRA document upload & verification
Vendor performance scoring
Blacklist / suspension history
Cross-fleet shared vendor intelligence
Design Note:This registry should be referenced by Purchasing, Tyre Replacement, Emergency Procurement, and Audit modules. No tyre enters the system without passing through this gate.
Vehicle Master & Axle Configuration
Module Purpose:This module defines how many tyres the system should expect for a specific vehicle (linked to a BX plate or fleet ID). It acts as a hard validation layer so users cannot overlog or underlog tyres (e.g., logging 6 tyres on a 4wheel Toyota Hilux).
This configuration becomes the truth table the rest of the tyre system obeys.
1) VEHICLE MASTER (Primary Identity)
Purpose: Establishes the vehicle archetype before any tyre data is captured.
Core Fields
Vehicle Identifier
BX Plate / Fleet ID
Vehicle Type (Dropdown)
Sedan
Hatchback
SUV
Bakkie / Pickup
Ambulance
Minibus
Bus
7Ton Truck
10Ton Truck
Articulated Truck / Horse
Trailer (Single / Double)
Drive Type (Optional but recommended)
FWD
RWD
AWD
4×4
2) AXLE CONFIGURATION
Purpose: Defines the physical axle layout and enforces tyre count rules.
Axle Count
2 Axles → Passenger cars, SUVs, bakkies
3 Axles → Rigid trucks, ambulances with rear dually
4+ Axles → Heavy trucks, articulated vehicles
Axle Type (Per Axle)
Each axle is defined independently:
Steering Axle
Drive Axle
Tag / Lift Axle
Trailer Axle
3) TYRE POSITION MAP (Critical Validation Layer)
Purpose: Explicitly defines every legal tyre position the vehicle may have.
Standard Position Naming Convention

Additional Axles (If Applicable):
Axle2Left / Axle2Right
Axle2InnerLeft / Axle2OuterLeft
Axle2InnerRight / Axle2OuterRight
4) PREDEFINED VEHICLE TEMPLATES (Recommended)
Example 1: Sedan (e.g., Toyota Corolla)
Axle Count: 2
Tyre Count: 4
Positions:
FL, FR, RL, RR
Example 2: Toyota Hilux / Ford Ranger
Vehicle Type: Bakkie
Axle Count: 2
Tyre Count: 4
Positions:
FL, FR, RL, RR
(System rule: Reject 5th or 6th tyre entries)
Example 3: Ambulance (Rear Dually)

Tyre Count: 10
Positions:
FL, FR
Axle2InnerLeft, Axle2OuterLeft
Axle2InnerRight, Axle2OuterRight
Axle3InnerLeft, Axle3OuterLeft
Axle3InnerRight, Axle3OuterRight
5) SYSTEM RULES & VALIDATION LOGIC
Hard Rules
Tyre entries must match the vehicle’s tyre position map
Extra tyre entries are rejected
Missing tyre positions are flagged
Tyre rotation only allowed between compatible positions
Soft Rules (Warnings)
Different brands on same axle
Different tread depth left vs right
Mismatched load or speed rating per axle
6) WHY THIS MODULE MATTERS
Prevents human error
Enforces mechanical realism
Enables axlebased analytics
Supports future features:
Tyre rotation history
Axle wear analysis
Fleet compliance audits
Design Note:This module should load before tyre capture, inspection, or replacement workflows. All downstream tyre data should reference this configuration as immutable truth.

Mobile Banks In Botswana's
In Botswana, when people refer to "all 3" in the context of mobile banking or mobile money, they are specifically talking about the services provided by the three major Mobile Network Operators (MNOs).
While there are many traditional banking apps (like FNBB, Absa, and Stanbic), these three mobile money platforms are the primary way TapFo users—especially those in rural areas or without traditional bank accounts—will handle payments like the VIP Pass (P20).
